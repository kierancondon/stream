## Summary of: 
# Separating Hype from Hydrogen, Parts One and Two

Author of the articles: ** Michael Liebreich **

## Part One - The Supply Side

### Ambition

- Two major EU plans published in July 2021:
    - "EU Strategy for Energy System Integration"
    - "Hydrogen Strategy for a Climate-Neutral Europe"
- EU projects increase of electrolyzer capacity from the current ** 60MW ** to ** 6GW ** by 2024 and to ** 40GW ** by 2030 and ** 500GW ** by 2050
- Powering these electrolyzers will require ** 80-120GW **  of new solar and wind generation
- Five countries have committed to a total of ** 26GW ** out of the 40GW electrolysis capacity target for 2030
- The hydrogen strategy would drive ** doubling ** of Europes power demand, power supply, power distribution capacity, and a Europe-wide hydrogen pipeline network

### Cost

- Electrolyzer costs have been plummeting with learning rates of just under ** 20% per doubling of capacity **, similar to wind energy.
- EU aims to drive price down from current ** 2.5 and 5.5 ** euros per kg, to between ** 1.1 and 2.4 ** euros per kg by ** 2030 **
- The EU Hydrogen Strategy wants to drive electrolyzers from ** 900 ** euros per kW to 450 euros/kW or less in the period after 2030 for ** PEM ** technology, which can ramp up and down
- Leading Chinese manufacturers, however, are already supplying equipment at ** $200/kW **... Using ** Alkaline ** technology, better for baseload

>> "The very idea of using surplus renewable energy to generate hydrogen will turn out to be, on the whole, a mirage. The only thing that matters is to produce the cheapest green hydrogen possible, or you will be out-competed."

- By 2050, Bloomberg NEF estimates that green hydrogen will be available at between ** $0.8 and $1.0 ** per kilo. (!!!)

- The EU Hydrogen Strategy estimates the current cost of producing blue hydrogen at ** 2 eur/kg ** (It is already cheaper than Green)


### Location:

- Renewable energy superpower regions (where Hydrogen will be produced)
    - Southern Europe, Morocco, the Gulf (*Not competitive from Northern Europe*)
    - Australia 
    - Mexico, Chile, Brazil, Southern U.S. 
    - China, India 

- Germany is planning to import clean electricity and green hydrogen
- Hydrogen Europe plans a ** 2 * 40 ** plan for 40 GW by 2030 in Europe and 40 GW in North Africa and Ukraine, indicating the cost advantage there
- green hydrogen based purely on offshore wind is unlikely to be competitive with production based on the ** combination of super-cheap solar and onshore wind, with batteries **, due to merged capacity factor near 80%

### Transport

- Distributing cheap green hydrogen around Europe should add between ** 7 and 50 euro cents per kilogram ** -  as long as it is done via a pipeline.
- Where there are no pipelines, the most viable vector is ** ammonia **. The total transportation cost, including conversion, storage... could be three times the cost of producing the hydrogen in the first place.
- Michael does not believe in 

### Conclusion

- Green hydrogen will probably be competitive with blue hydrogen by 2030
- Green hydrogen will almost be (but not quite) competitive with brown hydrogen in Europe 
- There will be vast amounts of green hydrogen, cheaper than brown hydrogen by 2050
- In Europe, much of it is likely to be imported, and the part made in Europe will not use exclusively European renewable power

## Part Two - The Demand Side

### Uses

- Chemical feedstock > irreplaceable
- Energy storage medium > inefficient, 50% round trip efficiency
- Source of work > fuel cell, turbine and engines are 60% efficient, not as good as electric motor
- Source of heat > Hydrogen costs 4* more than natural gas
- Energy transport > Hydrogen pipelines cost 3* more than power lines
